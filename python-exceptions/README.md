# Python - Exceptions

This project focuses on understanding and implementing exception handling in Python programming.

## Description

This project covers the fundamentals of Python exception handling, including:
- Understanding the difference between errors and exceptions
- Using try/except blocks to handle exceptions
- Implementing proper exception handling techniques
- Raising built-in exceptions
- Clean-up actions after exceptions

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this project, you should be able to explain:
- Why Python programming is awesome
- The difference between errors and exceptions
- What exceptions are and how to use them
- When to use exceptions
- How to correctly handle exceptions
- The purpose of catching exceptions
- How to raise built-in exceptions
- When to implement clean-up actions after exceptions

## Requirements

- Allowed editors: vi, vim, emacs
- All files interpreted/compiled on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS using python3 (version 3.8.5)
- All files should end with a new line
- First line of all files should be exactly `#!/usr/bin/python3`
- Code should use pycodestyle (version 2.7.*)
- All files must be executable
- File length will be tested using `wc`

## Files

- `1-safe_print_integer.py` - Function that prints an integer safely
- `2-safe_print_list_integers.py` - Function that prints only integers from a list
- `3-safe_print_division.py` - Function that divides 2 integers safely
- `4-list_division.py` - Function that divides element by element 2 lists
- `5-raise_exception.py` - Function that raises a type exception
- `6-raise_exception_msg.py` - Function that raises a name exception with a message
