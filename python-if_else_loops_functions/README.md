# Python - if/else, loops, functions

This directory contains Python scripts that demonstrate the use of conditional statements, loops, and functions in Python programming.

## Description

These programs are part of the ALU Higher Level Programming curriculum, focusing on:
- Conditional statements (if/else)
- Loops (while and for)
- Functions
- Python coding best practices

## Requirements

- All files are interpreted/compiled on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS using python3 (version 3.8.5)
- All files end with a new line
- The first line of all files is exactly `#!/usr/bin/python3`
- Code follows pycodestyle (version 2.7.*)
- All files are executable

## Files

| `0-positive_or_negative.py` | Program that determines if a randomly generated number is positive, negative, or zero |
| `1-last_digit.py` | Program that prints the last digit of a randomly generated number |
| `2-print_alphabet.py` | Program that prints the ASCII alphabet in lowercase |
| `3-print_alphabt.py` | Program that prints the ASCII alphabet in lowercase, excluding 'q' and 'e' |
| `4-print_hexa.py` | Program that prints numbers from 0 to 98 in decimal and hexadecimal |
