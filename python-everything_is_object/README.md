Python - Everything is object
This project explores Python's object model and how Python handles different types of objects, references, and assignments.

Description
This project focuses on understanding:

	* How Python treats everything as objects
	* The difference between mutable and immutable objects
	* Object references and aliases
	* How Python passes variables to functions
	* The difference between == and is operators

Learning Objectives
By the end of this project, you should be able to explain:

	* Why Python programming is awesome
	* What is an object
	* The difference between a class and an object or instance
	* The difference between immutable and mutable objects
	* What is a reference, assignment, and alias
	* How to know if two variables are identical or linked to the same object
	* How to display the variable identifier (memory address)
	* What are the built-in mutable and immutable types
	* How Python passes variables to functions

Requirements
Python Scripts
	* Allowed editors: vi, vim, emacs
	* All files interpreted/compiled on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS using python3 (version 3.8.5)
	* All files should end with a new line
	* First line of all files should be exactly #!/usr/bin/python3
	* Code should use pycodestyle (version 2.7.*)
	* All files must be executable

.txt Answer Files
	* Only one line
	* No Shebang
	* All files should end with a new line
