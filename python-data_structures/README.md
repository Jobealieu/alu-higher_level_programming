# Python - Data Structures: Lists, Tuples

This project covers the fundamentals of Python data structures, specifically focusing on lists and tuples. It's part of the ALU Higher Level Programming curriculum.

## Description

This project explores Python's built-in data structures and teaches how to effectively use lists and tuples in various programming scenarios. Through practical exercises, you'll learn list manipulation, tuple operations, and when to use each data structure appropriately.

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this project, you should be able to explain:

- Why Python programming is awesome
- What are lists and how to use them
- Differences and similarities between strings and lists
- Most common methods of lists and how to use them
- How to use lists as stacks and queues
- What are list comprehensions and how to use them
- What are tuples and how to use them
- When to use tuples versus lists
- What is a sequence
- What is tuple packing and sequence unpacking
- What is the `del` statement and how to use it

## Requirements

### Python Scripts
- Allowed editors: `vi`, `vim`, `emacs`
- All files interpreted/compiled on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS using python3 (version 3.8.5)
- All files should end with a new line
- First line of all files should be exactly `#!/usr/bin/python3`
- Code should use pycodestyle (version 2.7.*)
- All files must be executable
- File length will be tested using `wc`

## Files

| Filename | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| `0-print_list_integer.py` | Function that prints all integers of a list |
| `1-element_at.py` | Function that retrieves an element from a list |
| `2-replace_in_list.py` | Function that replaces an element in a list at a specific position |
| `3-print_reversed_list_integer.py` | Function that prints all integers of a list in reverse order |
| `4-new_in_list.py` | Function that replaces an element without modifying the original list |
| `5-no_c.py` | Function that removes all characters 'c' and 'C' from a string |
| `6-print_matrix_integer.py` | Function that prints a matrix of integers |
| `7-add_tuple.py` | Function that adds 2 tuples |
| `8-multiple_returns.py` | Function that returns a tuple with string length and first character |
| `9-max_integer.py` | Function that finds the biggest integer of a list |
| `10-divisible_by_2.py` | Function that finds all multiples of 2 in a list |
| `11-delete_at.py` | Function that deletes an item at a specific position in a list |
| `12-switch.py` | Program that switches the values of two variables |
