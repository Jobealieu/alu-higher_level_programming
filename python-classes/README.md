# Python - Classes and Objects

This project introduces Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) concepts in Python, focusing on classes and objects.

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this project, I will be able to explain:

- Why Python programming is awesome
- What is OOP (Object-Oriented Programming)
- What is "first-class everything"
- What is a class and what is an object/instance
- The difference between a class and an object or instance
- What is an attribute
- How to use public, protected and private attributes
- What is `self`
- What is a method
- What is the `__init__` method and how to use it
- Data Abstraction, Data Encapsulation, and Information Hiding
- What is a property
- The difference between an attribute and a property in Python
- The Pythonic way to write getters and setters
- How to dynamically create new attributes for existing instances
- How to bind attributes to objects and classes
- What is `__dict__` and what it contains
- How Python finds attributes of an object or class
- How to use the `getattr` function

## Requirements

- Python 3.8.5 on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS
- All files must be executable
- Code must follow pycodestyle (version 2.7.*)
- All modules, classes, and functions must have documentation
- First line of all files: `#!/usr/bin/python3`

## Files

- `0-square.py` - Empty Square class
- `1-square.py` - Square class with private size attribute
- `2-square.py` - Square class with size validation
- `3-square.py` - Square class with area calculation
- `4-square.py` - Square class with getter/setter for size
- `5-square.py` - Square class with print functionality
- `6-square.py` - Square class with position attribute
